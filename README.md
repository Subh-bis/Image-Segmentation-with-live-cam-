Title: Real-Time Facial Edge Detection with OpenCV

Description

This Python code demonstrates real-time facial edge detection using OpenCV. 
It captures video from your webcam, detects faces using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier, and applies Sobel filters to identify horizontal and vertical edges within the detected facial regions.

Features

Real-time face detection
Edge detection using Sobel filters
Horizontal and vertical edge visualization
Snapshot capture with keyboard shortcut ('s')
Display of saved snapshot
Requirements

Python 3 (tested with 3.x versions)
OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)
Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.

Install the required library using pip:

Bash
pip install opencv-python
Use code with caution.
Usage

Run the script from the command line:

Press the 's' key to capture a snapshot of the current frame. The image will be saved as snapshot.png.

A new window will display the saved snapshot. 
Press any key to close the snapshot window and exit the program.

Explanation

The code is well-structured and includes comments to enhance readability. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

Imports the OpenCV library (cv2).
Initializes the camera capture (cv2.VideoCapture(0)) for the default webcam.
Continuously reads frames from the camera using a loop.
Converts the frames to grayscale for efficient edge detection.
Loads the pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection (cv2.CascadeClassifier).
Detects faces in the grayscale frame using the classifier.
Iterates through detected faces:
Extracts the region of interest (ROI) for each face.
Creates a rectangle around the detected face for visualization.
Applies Sobel filters to the ROI to compute gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions.
Converts the Sobel filter outputs to grayscale (uint8) for display.
Combines the horizontal and vertical edges for visualization (optional).
Displays the detected facial ROI with its edges (horizontal and/or vertical).
Shows the original video frame with detected faces and edges overlaid.
Waits for the 's' key press to capture a snapshot.
Saves the current frame as snapshot.png.
Loads the saved snapshot and displays it in a separate window.
Waits for any key press in the snapshot window to close it and exit the program.
Properly releases the camera capture and closes all OpenCV windows.
Additional Notes

You can experiment with different parameters for the Sobel filter (e.g., ksize) to fine-tune edge detection sensitivity.
Consider using alternative edge detection algorithms (e.g., Canny edge detection) for different visual effects.
